            <p class=" text text-center images">Isadore (Issy) Sharp had no plans to<br> enter the hotel business on a
              grand<br> scale when the young architect and <br>builder – working with his contractor<br> father, Max
              Sharp –
              constructed his <br>first hotel. Over the course of this<br> decade, he opened
              three Four <br>Seasons hotels. Sharp’s experience<br> would pave the way for the creation <br>of a
              new kind of hotel, one focused<br> solely on the guest.</p>

            <p class=" text text-center images">The 1970s began with a defining <br> moment – the opening of a hotel in
              <br>London, England. This hotel set the <br>tone for the future direction of the <br>company and pioneered
              many of<br> the signature Four Seasons<br> services now delivered <br> worldwide. Within a few <br>years, the
              company’s portfolio also<br> included 10 hotels across Canada,<br> and its first US management<br>
              contracts, in San Francisco and <br>Chicago. By the close of the decade, <br>
              Four Seasons had entered the US <br>market under its own brand name
